Description: Chromatin looping is an important feature of
  eukaryotic genomes and can bring regulatory sequences, such as enhancers or 
  transcription factor binding sites, in close physical proximity of regulated 
  target genes.
  Here, we provide 7C, an R package that uses protein binding signals from ChIP-seq and
  sequence motif information to predict chromatin looping events. Cross-linking 
  of proteins that bind close to loop anchors result in ChIP-seq signals at both 
  anchor loci. These signals are used at CTCF motif pairs together with their 
  distance and orientation to each other to predict whether they interact or not.
  The resulting chromatin loops can be used to associate enhancers or 
  transcription factor binding sites (e.g. ChIP-seq peaks) to regulated target 
  genes.
